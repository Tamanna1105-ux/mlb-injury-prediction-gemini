# MLB Injury & Recovery Prediction with Gemini

This project uses machine learning and Google's Gemini models to predict player injuries and estimate recovery times in Major League Baseball.  Accurate predictions can help teams optimize player workloads, prevent injuries, and improve player development strategies.

## 1. Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.x
    *   [List any other prerequisites, e.g., specific versions of libraries]

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mlb-injury-prediction-gemini.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mlb-injury-prediction-gemini.git)
    cd mlb-injury-prediction-gemini
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Make sure you have a `requirements.txt` file listing all the project's dependencies.)

## 2. Usage

1.  **Running the Model:**
    ```bash
    python predict_injuries.py --player_data data/player_stats.csv --injury_history data/injury_history.csv --output_file predictions.csv
    ```
    (Replace `predict_injuries.py` with the name of your main script and adjust the command-line arguments as needed.)

2.  **Example Usage:**
    ```bash
    # Example to predict injuries for a specific player:
    python predict_injuries.py --player_id 12345
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    [Explain any configuration options, if applicable.]

## 3. Data

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   [Describe the data sources you used.  If it's publicly available, provide a link.  If not, explain how you obtained it (while respecting any data usage agreements).  E.g., "This project uses publicly available MLB player statistics from [source link] and historical injury data provided by [source/description]." ]

*   **Data Format:**
    *   [Describe the format of your data files (e.g., CSV, JSON).  If you can't share the actual data, provide a sample or a description of the columns.]

## 4. Model

*   **Model Description:**
    *   [Describe the machine learning model(s) you used.  E.g., "This project uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with LSTM layers to predict player injuries.  The model is trained on historical player data, injury history, and game statistics."]

*   **Gemini Integration:**
    *   [Explain how you used Gemini in your project. E.g., "Gemini was used to [specific task, e.g. enhance feature engineering by analyzing news articles about players, or directly for time-series forecasting of recovery times]."]

## 5. Evaluation

*   **Evaluation Metrics:**
    *   [List the metrics you used to evaluate your model's performance.  E.g., "The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for injury prediction, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for recovery time estimation."]

*   **Evaluation Results:**
    *   [Summarize your evaluation results.  Include any relevant tables or visualizations.]

## 6. Results

*   [Summarize the key findings and results of your project.  E.g., "The model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting player injuries and an MAE of 5 days in estimating recovery times.  Key risk factors identified by the model include [list key factors]."]
